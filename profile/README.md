## 🧠 Overview

**HidHide** is a specialized Windows utility created to control how input devices are exposed to applications. It allows users to selectively hide physical controllers from software while keeping them available for specific tools, enabling clean and conflict-free input handling.

The application is commonly used in advanced controller setups where multiple input layers are involved. By filtering device visibility at the system level, HidHide prevents duplicate inputs and eliminates unwanted controller detection in games and applications.

Designed for modern Windows systems, HidHide operates efficiently in the background and integrates seamlessly with controller management tools. Its precise control options make it a valuable component for gamers, developers, and power users who require reliable input configuration.
